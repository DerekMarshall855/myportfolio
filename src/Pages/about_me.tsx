                    <p> I am a detail-oriented and self-motivated Computer
                        Science and Psychology graduate with some experience in
                        software development, data analysis and problem
                        solving. I'm passionate about computer science and
                        eager to expand knowledge in web development. Mostly I interested in
                        backend design and implementation, but enjoy full stack and front end
                        development as well.

                    <p>
                        I graduated from Wilfrid Laurier University, double majoring in Computer Science and Psychology.
                        My overall average was a 10/12 (A-), while my computer science average was an 11/12 (A).
                        I was able to achieve high grades due to my passion for computer programming and my
                        high work ethic.
                    </p>
